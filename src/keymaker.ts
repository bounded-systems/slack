// slack .2 (prx-src) — keymaker capability PORT (interfaces only).
//
// ocap boundary: auth is factored out of the transport entirely. A keymaker is
// a credential BROKER that mints scoped, self-expiring keys from a held root
// authority — it does NOT authenticate (the OAuth login upstream does that); it
// ATTENUATES an already-held authority into least-authority keys.
//
// These are the port contracts the read surface depends on (dependency
// inversion: the consumer declares what it needs). The concrete keymaker —
// resolveSlackKeymaker() holding the root OAuth/refresh authority — lands in
// @bounded-systems/auth (slack .4b) and satisfies these structurally. Prior art
// + design rationale: spike prx-5u1 (biscuit/macaroon attenuation + Fulcio/Rekor
// provenance shape via the existing anchored-chain + RFC 8693 upgrade path).
//
// ENFORCEMENT LEVEL (honest threat model — do not overclaim). The "use,
// don't read / secret never exposed" guarantee below is a DISCIPLINE
// guarantee at the IN-PROCESS layer, not an ISOLATION one. Isolation in prx is
// a LAYERED PROFILE, not a single tier (composable defense in depth; a boundary
// is only as strong as the layer enforcing it):
//   - in-process (this code): Bun source+lint — capability seams + the package
//     extractability test. Trusts our own code; nothing stops malicious or
//     transitive in-process code from reading memory/env or spawning.
//   - agent: under `--vm` the whole agent runs in a Lima microVM (beadsd/dolt
//     already; the Claude session is being routed in — prx-69j/prx-bst). Strong.
//   - upgrade paths (fill the in-process gap): SES/hardened-JS Compartments
//     (ambient authority unreachable WITHOUT leaving Bun), Deno --allow-* gates
//     (GH-1836), WASI component model (capability-native, the structural endgame).
// Orthogonal axes bound credential USE regardless of isolation: network egress
// control (proxy → slack.com only) + this key's scope/TTL. So a leaked/minted key
// bounds blast radius by CONVENTION + short TTL + (if wired) egress, not by
// in-process sandboxing. See [[prx-capability-enforcement-level]].
